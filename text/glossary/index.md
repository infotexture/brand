## Glossary

Wire uses certain words in a special way. This glossary defines our terminology to make sure we all use the same words for the same things.

The list below includes ~~**deprecated terms**~~ that are either ambiguous or obsolete and should be replaced with the corresponding **→ preferred term**.

{: #accept} accept
: Answer an incoming voice call in a conversation

{: #answer} ~~answer~~ → [accept](#accept)
: Accept an incoming voice call in a conversation

{: #application} ~~application~~ → (specific client)
: Potentially confusing term that couples Wire platform with client apps.

{: #audio-message} audio message
: Record a brief sound clip and send it in a conversation.

{: #availability} ~~availability~~ → [status](#status)
: Best avoided, as "availability" is only one aspect of of status, and suggests some degree of automation. Take care to avoid language that conflates status states with automated presence indicators.

: User profile picture (icon) that appears in search results (not chat head or thumbnail)

{: #call} call
: Used as both noun and verb for the voice channel in a conversation (Conversation > Call).
