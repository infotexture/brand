## Glossary

Wire uses certain words in a special way. This glossary defines our terminology to make sure we all use the same words for the same things.

The list below includes ~~**deprecated terms**~~ that are either ambiguous or obsolete and should be replaced with the corresponding **→ preferred term**.

{: #accept} accept
: Answer an incoming voice call in a conversation.

{: #answer} ~~answer~~ → [accept](#accept)
: Accept an incoming voice call in a conversation.

{: #application} ~~application~~ → (specific client)
: Potentially confusing term that couples Wire platform with client apps.

{: #archive} archive
: Archiving a conversation removes it from the conversation list and moves it to the archive. Archived conversations can be restored to the conversation list with the [unarchive](#unarchive) command.

{: #audio-message} audio message
: Record a brief sound clip and send it in a conversation.

{: #availability} ~~availability~~ → [status](#status)
: Best avoided, as "availability" is only one aspect of of status, and suggests some degree of automation. Take care to avoid language that conflates status states with automated presence indicators.

{: #avatar} avatar
: User profile picture that appears in search results and conversations.

{: #bot} bot
: A non-human (robot) participant in a conversation. When you add a [service](#service) such as GitHub to a conversation via an [integration](#integration), a new bot is added to the conversation to represent the service.

{: #call} call
: Used as both noun and verb for the voice channel in a conversation (Conversation > Call).

{: #cellphone} ~~cellphone~~ → [phone](#phone)
: US-specific jargon for mobile telephone.

{: #change-password} ~~change password~~ → [reset password](#reset-password)
: Deprecated term for the password reset process.

{: #chat} ~~chat~~ → [conversation](#conversation)
: Informal term for 1:1 or group conversation. Use “conversation” if space allows.

{: #client} client
: A logged–in user account on a specific Wire installation. Users may have multiple clients if they are logged in on multiple Wire installations _(on desktop and mobile [devices](#device), or different desktop browsers)_. A Wire installation can also have multiple clients _(personal and team accounts on a single installation)_.

{: #conversation} conversation
: Preferred term for 1:1 or group chat. If space is tight or context is informal, “chat” is OK.

{: #contacts} contacts
: People you’re connected to on Wire. Provide context to avoid confusion with the system address book.

{: #create-account} create account
: Preferred term for registration/signup.

{: #decline} decline
: Ignore or reject an incoming voice or video call.

{: #desktop-application} desktop application
: Wire client for desktop computers (macOS, Linux, Windows).

{: #device} device
: An Wire installation on a physical piece of electronic equipment, such as an iPhone, an Android tablet or a Windows PC. On mobile platforms, users typically run one instance per device, but on desktop computers, users may log in with multiple Wire [clients](#client) using different browsers.

{: #hang-up} hang up
: End an ongoing voice or video call.

{: #icon} ~~icon~~ → [avatar](#avatar)
